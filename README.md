Implemented some of the following programming techniques in JavaScript:
- HTML insertions
- array methods (.slice, .splice, .reduce, .filter, .map, .forEach)
- event listeners with corresponding event handler callback functions
- optional chaining
- short circuiting
- DOM Manipulation of HTML and CSS items
